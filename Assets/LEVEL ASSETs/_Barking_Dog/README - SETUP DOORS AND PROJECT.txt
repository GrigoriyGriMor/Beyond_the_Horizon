Hi dear customer :) or CG persia member... :)

I'm glad to present my new scifi kit! It's the result of few days of work (5 months full
time, to be exact) i hope that the kit give you satisfaction, i'm always proud when i see
some games made with my datas.

Please, a small review/and stars rating should be really appreciated :) 


						----------------------------------------
						Here is some tips, how to setup etc... :
						----------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
First to do (before importing package) : IMPORTANT
--------------------------------------------------

- Create a new project.
- You need to configure your project (build settings) "GAMMA" to "LINEAR".
- Import the Base Kit Vol 1.


-----------------
Light & rendering
-----------------

When you load the kit, is it possible that the rendering was black! Do not panic...
Just open the window lightning and re-bake the lightning... Do not send me mail :)

The kit work very well with this : https://github.com/keijiro/KinoObscurance
One of the better SSAO i have see... Do not contact me for support about it...

-----------------
About the doors :
-----------------

You need to make this, if you get problems with open/close procedure :

In unity search all gameobjects named (without cote): 

"Door_L" (put them to static off) 
"Door_R" (put them to static off) 

This operation allow you to get the door opening, but! If you you want to lightmap/bake
you need to redo the same operation (search) but static them again!

I know it's a pain in the ass, but i don't make the rules :)

--------------------------------
About the damn missing object :)
--------------------------------

It's a rule, a kit can't fit 100% of your needs for your game... Creating a kit is not 
really easy.

In fact, when i start? And when i finish it? For this reason, i try to get informations
from my customer's, and the pack content is a bit the result of many anger mails that i
receive:) 

"The pack suxx, i need a scanner!"
"I want a computer like startrek!" 
"There is a missing object, a solar panel"

Etc etc etc... You need to know one thing, there is alway a missing object in a kit :)
And you need to work to create a game, a bit :) A kit is a starting base....

That's why this kit contains a reduced number of textures, to allow your graphic designer 
to understand his philosophy.A good graphic designer will be able to use the existing 
textures set, to map new objects.

Many objects are mapped with the diffuse one :)

------------------------------
Texture batching for your need
------------------------------

The textures named XXX_Dif.png are some ID textures, you can use them with DDO. In fact
all you need for ddo is provided : ID / AO / NORM / METAL

You can customize the textures :) Updates are planed, be carreful with diffuse with big
black background, it is possible that i'm adding some shits on.
