## CTI Runtime Components LWRP

In case you want to use CTI shaders along with the LWRP or URP you have to import the "CTI Runtime Components LWRP" package that will come with shaders for LWRP and further details in the "Custom Tree Importer 3.0 LWRP" PDF.
Please note that when using LWRP or URP only basic CTI LOD shaders are supported.
