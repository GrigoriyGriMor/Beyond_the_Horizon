Unfortunately with version 2018.2. Unity introduced a new way of handling lod fading in shaders. This does not let us write one unified cti lod tree leaves shader which would work in unity 5.3. as well as in 2018.2. or above.
The package you have downloaded from the asset store will contain the old < 2018.2. cti lod tree leaves shader. But in case you want to use cti in Unity >= 2018.2. or want to ship trees that run in unity >= 2018.2. simply import the "2018.2_CTI_LOD_Leaves_Shader_Fix" package, located in "CTI Runtime Components". This will overwrite the "old" tree leaves shader with a version which runs properly in 2018.2.
